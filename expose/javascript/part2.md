1. The console will print the value of i, which was increased until it is the size of the array prices minus one (2).
2. The console will print the last value of discountedPrice, which was the price of the late indexed item in the array prices when the discount rate is applied to the item (150).
3. The console will print the last value of finalPrice, which was the last value of discountedPrice multipied by 100 rounded by Math.round, and then divided by 100 (150).
4. The function will return the final array of discounted, which were the prices of each item in the array prices when a discount multiplier was applied, and then multiplied by 100 and rounded to the nearest integer and then divided by 100.
5. Error, i was declared in the for-loop scope and was called out of the scope.
6. Error, discountedPrice was declared in the for-loop score and was called out of the scope.
7. The console will print the last value of finalPrice, which was the last value of discountedPrice multipied by 100 rounded by Math.round, and then divided by 100 (150).
8. The function will return the final array of discounted, which were the prices of each item in the array prices when a discount multiplier was applied, and then multiplied by 100 and rounded to the nearest integer and then divided by 100 [50, 100, 150].
9. Error, i was declared in the for-loop scope and was called out of the scope.
10. The console will print the value of length, which is the length of the price array.
11. The function will return the final array of discounted, which were the prices of each item in the array prices when a discount multiplier was applied [50, 100, 150].
12a. student.name
12b. student['Grad Year]
12c. student.greeting()
12d. student['Favorite Teacher'][name]
12e. student.courseLoad[0]
13a. '32' number is converted to string since operation is addition and '3' is a string.
13b. 1 string is converted to number since operation is subtraction and 1 is a number.
13c. 3 null is converted to 0 since operaton is addition and 3 is a number.
13d. '3null' null is converted to string since operation is addition and '3' is a string.
13e. 4 true is converted to 1 since operation is addition and 3 is a number.
13f. 0 since null is converted to 0 and false is converted to 0 since the operation is addition.
13g. '3undefined' since undefined is converted to string since '3' is a string.
13h. NaN since operation is subtraction.
14a. true since '2' is converted to number.
14b. false since '2' and '12' are converted to number.
14c. true since '2' is converted to number.
14d. false since it's strict equality comparing and they are different types.
14e. false since true is converted to 1.
14f. true since Boolean(2) is converted to true.
15. === is a strict equality test among types, and == is an equality test with automatic type conversions allowed.
17. For every element in array, we apply the callback function to each element (which in this case is doSomething and multiplies it by 2) and then push it into the newArr and return the new array. The resulting array would be [2, 4, 6]
