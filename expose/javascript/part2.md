1. The console will print the value of i, which was increased until it is the size of the array prices minus one (2).
2. The console will print the last value of discountedPrice, which was the price of the late indexed item in the array prices when the discount rate is applied to the item (150).
3. The console will print the last value of finalPrice, which was the last value of discountedPrice multipied by 100 rounded by Math.round, and then divided by 100 (150).
4. The function will return the final array of discounted, which were the prices of each item in the array prices when a discount multiplier was applied, and then multiplied by 100 and rounded to the nearest integer and then divided by 100.
5. Error, i was declared in the for-loop scope and was called out of the scope.
6. Error, discountedPrice was declared in the for-loop score and was called out of the scope.
7. The console will print the last value of finalPrice, which was the last value of discountedPrice multipied by 100 rounded by Math.round, and then divided by 100 (150).
